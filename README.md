KAGSA HTML is a framework that allows you to use the KAGSA language codes within HTML. It provides an easy way to add KAGSA functionality to your front-end development projects.

## Quick Start

To get started with KAGSA HTML, follow these simple steps:

1. Install `kagsa.js` and `kagsa.css` or import them directly from the GitHub file raw.
   
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="kagsa.css">
<script src="kagsa.js"></script>
```

2. Use the `kagsa` tag to start writing KAGSA codes inside your HTML.

```html
<kagsa>
   // KAGSA codes here
</kagsa>
```

That's it! You are now ready to use the power of KAGSA within your front-end development projects. For more information on how to use KAGSA HTML, please refer to the documentation.
